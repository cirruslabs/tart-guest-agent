# Guest agent for Tart VMs

A guest agent for Tart VMS is a lightweight background service that runs inside the virtual machine and enables enhanced communication between the host and guest and other useful features, such as automatic disk resizing.

Currently implemented features:

* Automatic disk resizing for macOS VMs with recovery partition removed (`--resize-disk`)
* Clipboard sharing for macOS VMs using our in-house SPICE vdagent implementation (`--run-vdagent`)
